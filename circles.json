      "description":"Martin Bryant woke up at 6am at his house, a property that he inherited from his girlfriend who died earlier that year in a car crash. Martin was in the car with her when she died. He told police that she drove off of the road to avoid a dog that was jumping around. Martin was known to have taken the wheel while Mrs. Harvey was driving, causing multiple previous accidents.",
